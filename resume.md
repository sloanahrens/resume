#### Professional Goals
- Solving interesting business problems at scale with data-engineering cloud-software solutions.
- Implementing holistic “Joel-test”-pattern software/data engineering systems, development-patterns and DevOps principles to ensure business process stability and reliability, and minimize stress.
- Constantly improving skills, learning new tools and patterns, following the evolution of Internet technologies.

#### Software/Data Engineering Deliverables
- data ETL pipelines, with scripted automation and testing
- data-driven web applications presenting RESTful APIs
- modern reactive UI front-ends consuming back-end APIs and managing tasks
- asynchronous/scheduled data task-processing for data ETL, report generation, heavy computation
- scripted, fully automated, source-control-driven QA-testing pipeline that finds problems before deployment
- automated code-deployments and updates, with monitoring, logs, failover and rollback
- fast debugging of problems, learn from the error and write a test around it
- all infrastructure and scripted processes exist as code in source-control, infrastructure can be rebuilt quickly from code
- automated snapshots and backups of important data, with regional data-center failover

#### Tool Proficiencies
- Python programming language, especially using Flask, Django and Celery library families
- Client-side JavaScript UI programming, most recently with Vue.js and Bootstrap-Vue
- SQL and Non-SQL databases, especially PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch
- DevOps tools including: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS
- Joel-friendly code-base and DevOps organization, including: Infrastructure-as-code + Source-control + Automated testing + Microservices + Containerization + Orchestration + Cloud + Monitoring + CI/CD
- Experience with Agile/SCRUM, task-management tools like JIRA, source-control/issue-tracking with Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket
- Basic familiarity with numerous data-science and machine-learning concepts, some experience with related Python libraries

#### General Qualities
- Experience managing “full-stack” software development projects, debugging systems, putting out deployment fires.
- Fast learner, can pick up new tools quickly, lots of experience debugging tough technical problems.
- Excellent technical writer, with an expert grasp of the English language.
- Relentless problem-solver -- I am driven to figure out and solve mysterious tech issues.

### Employment/Contracting History Highlights

- **12/2020 - 1/2021: Emory Solutions**: analyzed complex, technical-debt ridden industrial business logic, built data-reporting application (as a consulting experiment) to mitigate business-process pain.
-- *Tech: K8s, Docker, AWS, Django, Vue.js*

- **2/2020 - 9/2020: Qbox**: migrated legacy system to new cloud environment with better maintainability and failover; built CI/orchestration devops system for new microservice-based application.
-- *Tech: TravisCI, Terraform, K8s, Docker, AWS, Python, Flask, JavaScript, Vue.js*

- **5/2015 - 3/2019 (with some gaps): Lofty Labs**: built core part of (and touched nearly every aspect of) a complex client-facing machine-learning-as-a-service system, and managed cloud deployments; retail data ingestion pipeline (for retail analyst); massive email corpus ETL and search/flagging system (for legal discovery); cloud migrations; devops upgrades, various small projects.
-- *Tech: CircleCI, Terraform, Ansible, K8s, Docker, AWS (mostly EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, Route53), Python, Flask/Django, JavaScript, Ember.js*

- **7/2012 - 2/2014: StackSearch**: co-founded a “start-up” around data-search functionality add-on for e-commerce websites, attended the Ark Challenge accelerator as a founder, built core tech and early engineering team.
-- *Tech: Microsoft C#.NET and SQL-Server*

- **4/2010 - 8/2012: High Impact Analytics**: built full-stack database-driven system to automate weekly retail data ingestion and report generation to help a retail analyst scale up his client-base.
-- *Tech: Microsoft C#.NET and SQL-Server*

- **9/2011- 8/2012: @ddress**: this was a well-funded but ill-fated “hyper-local” social media platform on which I worked as a junior full-stack developer, deploying to early managed Google cloud infrastructure, building back-end and front-end components for essentially an early form of facebook groups, but with sophisticated geo-hash search capabilities, all of which is now very obsolete.
-- *Tech: Google App Engine, Django, Python, Early Google-Maps API*

- **3/2008 - 6/2009: Mill Creek Software**: trained as a junior “full-stack” developer with Microsoft’s software development tools; worked on several client projects including business management software for a large summer-camp company and a heavy construction blasting company.
-- *Tech: Microsoft C#.NET, VB.NET, SQL-Server, Python, Django, PostgreSQL*

### Education:

- Bachelor of Science in Physics, Minor in Computer Science, University of Arkansas -
Fayetteville, graduated 2005.
- Undergraduate job writing PDF homework/test solutions (with LaTeX and Adobe Illustrator) for calculus-based introductory physics classes, used by hundreds of students each semester; deploying and managing (very simple) class website.
- Worked toward (but did not complete) Master of Science in Physics at UA.
- Taught four semesters of lab courses for calculus-based introductory physics classes, including lab setup, some lecturing, lots of problem-solving, lots of helping students with homework problems.
- Conducted research involving the numerical calculation of fully relativistic gravitational
radiation signatures, coded in MATLAB, C and Fortran.
