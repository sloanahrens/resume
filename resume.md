### Employment/Contracting History Highlights

- **12/2020 - 1/2021: Emory Solutions**: analyzed complex, technical-debt ridden industrial business logic, built data-reporting application (as a consulting experiment) to mitigate business-process pain.
-- *Tech: K8s, Docker, AWS, Django, Vue.js*

- **2/2020 - 9/2020: Qbox**: migrated legacy system to new cloud environment with better maintainability and failover; built CI/orchestration devops system for new microservice-based application.
-- *Tech: TravisCI, Terraform, K8s, Docker, AWS, Python, Flask, JavaScript, Vue.js*

- **5/2015 - 3/2019 (with some gaps): Lofty Labs**: built core part of (and touched nearly every aspect of) a complex client-facing machine-learning-as-a-service system, and managed cloud deployments; retail data ingestion pipeline (for retail analyst); massive email corpus ETL and search/flagging system (for legal discovery); cloud migrations; devops upgrades, various small projects.
-- *Tech: CircleCI, Terraform, K8s, Docker, AWS, Python, Flask/Django, JavaScript, Ember.js*

- **7/2012 - 2/2014: StackSearch**: co-founded a “start-up” around data-search functionality add-on for e-commerce websites, attended the Ark Challenge accelerator as a founder, built core tech and early engineering team.
-- *Tech: Microsoft C#.NET and SQL-Server*

- **4/2010 - 8/2012: High Impact Analytics**: built full-stack database-driven system to automate weekly retail data ingestion and report generation to help a retail analyst scale up his client-base.
-- *Tech: Microsoft C#.NET and SQL-Server*

- **9/2011- 8/2012: @ddress**: this was a well-funded but ill-fated “hyper-local” social media platform on which I worked as a junior full-stack developer, deploying to early managed Google cloud infrastructure, building back-end and front-end components for essentially an early form of facebook groups, but with sophisticated geo-hash search capabilities, all of which is now very obsolete.
-- *Tech: Google App Engine, Django, Python, Early Google-Maps API*

- **3/2008 - 6/2009: Mill Creek Software**: trained as a junior “full-stack” developer with Microsoft’s software development tools; worked on several client projects including business management software for a large summer-camp company and a heavy construction blasting company.

### Education:
