### Job-search Goals
- Remote only. I'm happy to go on-site for a meeting with management or clients here and there if needed (even if it requires traveling), but I want to primarily work from home, even after covid.
- Salary at least $120k per year, and preferably more like $150k. For 1099 contract work the numbers are $120/$150 per hour.
- Linux environment is much preferred.
- A job that is mostly DevOps work, and where I'm not the only DevOps engineer.
- An environment organized such that it more-or-less passes the Joel Test (https://blog.hubspot.com/service/joel-test).
- A software system that leverages the microservices + containerization + orchestration paradigm, as well as CI/CD.
- It's important to me to work in an environment that is ALREADY using Kubernetes, because that's one of the skills I want to hone.
- I want to work with people better at K8s than me, and learn from them. I have reasonable Kubernetes skills now, but I want to master it. I'm working on the first K8s certification now, and I'd like to get all three.
- I would prefer to work in AWS over Azure or Google, because all my experience is in AWS. It might not be a deal-breaker if everything else is right.
- I have experience with Terraform, and I would also like to get better with that, so bonus points if they are using it (it's pretty common).
- I don't have Jenkins experience but I think I can pick it up pretty quickly if I need to. I've used CircleCI and TravisCI, but I could pick up any hosted CI/CD platform quickly (GitHub seems like a good one).
- I have experience writing bash scripts for automated testing, and I can use Python for scripting as well.
- I do have experience with Python, Django, Celery, Redis, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, vanilla JavaScript, and Vue.js (with the Bootstrap-Vue plugin), so if those tools are used in the tech-stack that's a bonus because it will be easier for me to interact with. It's probably not essential, though, since the DevOps work might be only loosely connected to all that.
- I would like to get some experience with the Go programming language, one of these days, so bonus points if there's a chance for that.
- I want to work on interesting, innovative products. Green-field projects are definitely a plus.

### Technical Goals
- Go programming language training and experience, if feasible.
- Better Bash/Linux command-line skills.
- Kubernetes experience, training and certifications.
- Cloud training and certifications, preferably AWS.
- Large, complex CI pipelines, functional testing systems, and data-engineering systems.
- Working as part of a team of dozens or possibly hundreds of engineers.
- Working with talented DevOps engineers that will help me master the tools, processes and standards of modern DevOps.
